I won't be walking on thin ice to get through the night. \n Hey, where's your work? What's your game? I know your business but I don't know your name... Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous. She's got what it takes to make ends meet the eyes of a lover that hit like heat. You know she's a little bit dangerous. \n You turn around,
so hot and dry. You are hiding under a halo, your mouth is alive. Get out of my way! Get out of my sight! I am not attracted to go-go deeper tonight. \n Hey, what is your word? What is your game? I know your business but I don't know your name... Hold on tight...",
    "JOYRIDE": "I hit the road out of nowhere / I had to jump in my car / And be a rider in a love game / Following the stars / Don't need no book of wisdom, I get no money talk at all / She has a train going downtown / She's got a club on the moon / And she's telling all her secrets / In a wonderful balloon \n She's the heart of the funfair / She's got me whistling her private tune / And it all begins where it ends / And she's all mine, my magic friend / She says: Hello, you fool, I love you, Come on join the joyride, Join the joyride \n She's a flower, I can paint her / She's a child of the sun / We're a part of this together / Could never turn around and run / Don't need no fortune teller / To know where my lucky love belongs / Oh no \n Cause it all begins again when it ends, And we're all magic friends \n She says: Hello, you fool, I love you, Come on join the joyride, Join the joyride \n Be a joyrider \n I take you on a skyride, A feeling like you're spellbound / The sunshine is a lady, Who ROX you like a baby \n She says: Hello, you fool, I love you, Come on join the joyride, Join the joyride",
