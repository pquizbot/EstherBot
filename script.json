    "JOYRIDE": "I hit the road out of nowhere 
I had to jump in my car 
And be a rider in a love game 
Following the stars 
Don't need no book of wisdom 
I get no money talk at all 

She has a train going downtown 
She's got a club on the moon 
And she's telling all her secrets 
In a wonderful balloon 

She's the heart of the funfair 
She's got me whistling her private tune 

And it all begins where it ends 
And she's all mine, my magic friend 

She says: Hello, you fool, I love you 
Come on join the joyride 
Join the joyride 

She's a flower, I can paint her 
She's a child of the sun 
We're a part of this together 
Could never turn around and run 
Don't need no fortune teller 
To know where my lucky love belongs, 
Oh no 

Cause it all begins again when it ends 
And we're all magic friends 

She says: Hello, you fool, I love you 
Come on join the joyride 
Join the joyride 

Be a joyrider 

I take you on a skyride 
A feeling like you're spellbound 
The sunshine is a lady 
Who ROX you like a baby 

She says: Hello, you fool, I love you 
Come on join the joyride 
Join the joyride"
